# Machine_Learning
# this project will contain some of the most important machine learning and data-analysis techniques
# When the new files will be added, corresponding description will also be added with file name and DDMMYY. 
# base of these programs are machine learning codes influenced from Muller's Machine Learning with Python book. Later on many extra techniques are implemented. 
# PCA_Muller.py 190818: Principal component analysis example with breast cancer data-set. Detailed description of this code is discussed in here https://towardsdatascience.com/dive-into-pca-principal-component-analysis-with-python-43ded13ead21 . After this un-supervised machine learning technique, we will move to some very well known supervised machine learning methods like KNearestNeighbor and LinearRegression and so on.
