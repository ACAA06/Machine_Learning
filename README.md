# Machine_Learning
# this project will contain some of the most important machine learning and data-analysis techniques
## When the new files will be added, corresponding description will also be added with file name and DDMMYY. 
### base of these programs are machine learning codes influenced from Muller's Machine Learning with Python book. Later on many extra techniques are implemented.
*PCA_Muller.py 190818:* Principal component analysis example with breast cancer data-set. Detailed description of this code is discussed in [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/dive-into-pca-principal-component-analysis-with-python-43ded13ead21).

*270918: RidgeandLin.py, LassoandLin.py:* Lasso and Ridge regression examples: From coefficient shrinakge in Ridge to feature selection in Lasso are shown in the code. The concepts and discussion of the results are discussed [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/ridge-and-lasso-regression-a-complete-guide-with-python-scikit-learn-e20e34bcbf0b).   

*081018: bank.csv*, data set of portuguese company selling products to random customer over a phone call. Detailed description are available [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)

*161018: gender_purchase.csv*, data-set of two columns describing customers buying a product depending on gender.

*111118: winequality-red.csv*, red wine data set, where the output is the quality column which ranges from 0 to 10.

*121118: pipelineWine.py*, Contains a simple example of applying pipeline and gridsearchCV together using the red wine data. More description can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-example-of-pipeline-in-machine-learning-with-scikit-learn-e726ffbb6976). 

*24112018 lagmult.py*, this program just demonstrate a simple constrained optimization problem using figures. Uses Lagrange Multiplier method.  

*11122018 Consumer_Complaints_short.csv*, 3 columns describing the complaints, product_label and category. Complete file can be obtained from [Govt.data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database/resource/2f297213-7198-4be1-af1e-2d2623e7f6e9). File size is around 650 MB. More details about the usage of this file will be uploaded soon when the text classification program is ready. 

*13122018: Text-classification_compain_suvo.py*, Classify the consumer complaints data, which is already described above. The file deals with the complete data-set (650 MB). After testing several ML algorithms, Linear SVM works best. Higher the computer resources, higher amount of rows can be considered for TfidfVectorizer. 

*1912018: SVMdemo.py*, this program shows the effect of using RBF kernel to map from 2d space to 3d space. Animation requires ffmpeg in unix system. 

*05032019: IBM_Python_Web_Scrapping.ipynb*, Deals with basic web scrapping, string handling, image manipulation while we generate fake cover for our band.
