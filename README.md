# Machine_Learning
# this project will contain some of the most important machine learning and data-analysis techniques
# When the new files will be added, corresponding description will also be added with file name and DDMMYY. 
# base of these programs are machine learning codes influenced from Muller's Machine Learning with Python book. Later on many extra techniques are implemented. 
# PCA_Muller.py 190818: Principal component analysis example with breast cancer data-set. Detailed description of this code is discussed in here https://towardsdatascience.com/dive-into-pca-principal-component-analysis-with-python-43ded13ead21 . After this un-supervised machine learning technique, we will move to some very well known supervised machine learning methods like KNearestNeighbor and LinearRegression and so on.  

270918: RidgeandLin.py, LassoandLin.py: Lasso and Ridge regression examples: From coefficient shrinakge in Ridge to feature selection in Lasso are shown in the code. The concepts and discussion of the results are shown here (https://towardsdatascience.com/ridge-and-lasso-regression-a-complete-guide-with-python-scikit-learn-e20e34bcbf0b).
