# Machine_Learning
# this project will contain some of the most important machine learning and data-analysis techniques
## When the new files will be added, corresponding description will also be added with file name and DDMMYY. 
### base of these programs are machine learning codes influenced from Muller's Machine Learning with Python book. Later on many extra techniques are implemented. \
PCA_Muller.py 190818: Principal component analysis example with breast cancer data-set. Detailed description of this code is discussed in here https://towardsdatascience.com/dive-into-pca-principal-component-analysis-with-python-43ded13ead21 . After this un-supervised machine learning technique, we will move to some very well known supervised machine learning methods like KNearestNeighbor and LinearRegression and so on. \ 

270918: RidgeandLin.py, LassoandLin.py: Lasso and Ridge regression examples: From coefficient shrinakge in Ridge to feature selection in Lasso are shown in the code. The concepts and discussion of the results are shown here (https://towardsdatascience.com/ridge-and-lasso-regression-a-complete-guide-with-python-scikit-learn-e20e34bcbf0b). \    

081018: bank.csv, data set of portuguese company selling products to random customer over a phone call. Detailed description are available here http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing \
161018: gender_purchase.csv, data-set of two columns describing customers buying a product depending on gender.\
111118: winequality-red.csv, red wine data set, where the output is the quality column which ranges from 0 to 10. This output is unbalanced as most of them are normal. So be careful!!\
121118: pipelineWine.py, this program contains a simple example of applying pipeline and gridsearchCV together using the red wine data. More description can be found here https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-example-of-pipeline-in-machine-learning-with-scikit-learn-e726ffbb6976 \
24/11/2018 lagmult.py, this program just solves constrained optimization problem using plots. Basically contains an example of Lagrange's multiplier method.
